                        <p><u>About me</u></p>I was born in Bangkok, Thailand.  
                        I moved to United States 10 years ago. In my free time I like to spend time with my family.
                        I like to go hiking. I enjoy adventures.
                        My favorite place to go is the beach, I hope to have my own beach house someday!</p>

                        <p>I graudated from Everygreen High School in 2015. I recivced a Certitied Nursing Assistant in 2017 and was hired while doing clinical. 
                        I had been working at QFC for 3 years. Started as a cashier position and now working under management.
                        I was always interested in computer and want to learn more about it, so I choose Epicodus to be part of my learning! </p>
