                        <p><u>About me</u></p>I was born in Bangkok, Thailand.  
                        I moved to United States 10 years ago.
                        I like to go hiking. I enjoy adventures with my family.
                        My favorite place to go is the beach, I hope to have my own beach house someday!  
                        In my free time I like to spend time with my family.
                        </p>

                        <p>I graudated from Everygreen High School in 2015. </p>
